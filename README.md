<!-- Data Sources -->
## Data Sources
The data used in this project is sourced from reputable clinical trial databases, such as PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and relevant research publications. The dataset includes information on patients, treatments, outcomes, and other relevant variables.

<!-- Folium -->
## Folium
The project leverages Folium, a Python library for creating interactive maps, to visualize the geographical distribution of clinical trial locations. The interactive maps provide a comprehensive overview of the trial sites and their distribution across different regions.

<!-- Supervised Learning for Weights -->
## Supervised Learning for Weights
To optimize the weightings of various factors in the analysis, supervised learning techniques are employed. The model learns from the historical data to assign appropriate weights to different variables, enabling more accurate predictions and insights.

<!-- Repository Structure -->
