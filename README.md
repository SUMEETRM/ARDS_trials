<!-- Data Sources -->
## :file_folder: Data Sources

The `ards_data` folder in this repository hosts several key datasets that are instrumental for our analysis on Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and associated factors. 

Here is a breakdown of the datasets included:

- :hospital: `ARDS_centers`: Contains names and geographic coordinates of hospitals known for their specialization in ARDS treatment. Data is originally sourced from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=ARDS&map_cntry=US&draw=2&rank=1#rowId0).

- :chart_with_upwards_trend: `County_COPD_prevalence`: A dataset from the CDC that provides information about the prevalence of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) at a county level.

- :swimmer: `Drowning_data`: A dataset providing insights into drowning incidents, sourced from the CDC.

- :sneezing_face: `flu_data`: This dataset contains data on flu cases, as provided by the CDC.

- :face_with_thermometer: `Pnem`: Includes data related to pneumonia cases, also sourced from the CDC.

- :mask: `Covid_nyt`: Contains detailed COVID-19 case data, sourced from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html).

- :ambulance: `Sepsis1`: CDC-sourced dataset containing detailed case data on sepsis.

- :syringe: `Vaccination`: Includes data related to flu vaccination rates.

- üó∫Ô∏è `uscounties`: A comprehensive dataset containing details about US county coordinates, population figures, and FIPS codes.

- :smoking: `Tobacco`: A dataset that provides insights into tobacco usage rates.

- :us: `States.csv`: A dataset containing the names, abbreviations, and central coordinates of US states.

Refer to the original data sources for more comprehensive details and context about these datasets.



<!-- Folium -->
## Folium
The project leverages Folium, a Python library for creating interactive maps, to visualize the geographical distribution of clinical trial locations. The interactive maps provide a comprehensive overview of the trial sites and their distribution across different regions.

## :open_file_folder: Random Forest for Feature Importance

This directory houses a Python script that employs the Random Forests technique as a means of calculating the optimal importance of various risk factors in our Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) research. 

We've transitioned to the use of random forests from a previous constrained optimization approach (SLSQP) to achieve higher R-squared values, reflecting an improved fit of the model to the data.

:arrow_down_small: Here is a brief overview of the key steps in the script:

1. Import required libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn)
2. Load the dataset 'state_data_1.csv'
3. Normalize the risk factors and mortality rates using `StandardScaler` from Sklearn
4. Modify the 'normalized_vaccination' column since higher vaccination rates imply lower rates of ARDS according to studies
5. Define the features (risk factors) and target (mortality rates)
6. Initialize and fit the Random Forest Regressor with the defined features and target
7. Run predictions using the trained model and the features
8. Calculate and print the R-squared score as a measure of the model's fit to the data
9. Extract and return the feature importances as determined by the Random Forest model, which are the optimal weights to be used for the various risk factors in further analysis. 

Our shift to random forests has enhanced our model's performance, and the feature importances computed by the Random Forest Regressor offer more robust insights into which risk factors contribute most to ARDS mortality. These weights, or importances, are then used to generate a heatmap for visual interpretation of our results.



<!-- Repository Structure -->
## :open_file_folder: Repository Structure

This repository is structured in a way that makes the analysis flow intuitive and easy to follow. Here's a quick tour:

- :notebook: `ards_map.ipynb`: This is the primary Jupyter notebook where all the code runs. It integrates various components of the project and generates a detailed heatmap in HTML format. The code in this notebook is modular, making it easy to reuse and adapt to your needs.

- :balance_scale: `weight_optimization.py`: This Python script contains an optimization algorithm that calculates the best-suited weights for generating the weighted Folium heatmap. The weights are derived from a supervised learning algorithm optimized against an ARDS mortality study.

- :globe_with_meridians: `usa_map.html`: This is a ready-to-use HTML map showcasing 500 clinical trial locations in a heatmap format. It's a direct product of running the `ards_map.ipynb` notebook.

- :gear: `dataloader.py`: This Python script is responsible for loading all the necessary data from the `ards_data` folder.

- :file_folder: `ards_data`: This folder is the data repository hosting several datasets used in the analysis. For a more detailed description of the individual datasets, please refer to the [Data Sources](#data-sources) section.

- :bookmark_tabs: `ards_state_vals`: This file contains state-wise ARDS mortality rates, as derived from a linked study.

- :page_facing_up: `ARDS_locations.csv`: This CSV file offers comprehensive data on various studies, including details such as the number of participants, participant age and sex, study dates, and updates on study completion.
